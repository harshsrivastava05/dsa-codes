Full Binary Tree
In a full binary tree, every node has either 0 or two children. It is also referred to as a strict binary tree.

Perfect Binary Tree
As the name suggests, a perfect binary tree is one in which all the nodes(internal nodes) have two children and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

Complete Binary Tree
In a complete binary tree, all the levels except the last level(that contains the leaf nodes) should be full. In this type of binary tree, the node should be inserted to the left first, i.e., left-leaning (it is not mandatory to have a right sibling for the node).

Degenerate or Pathological Tree
In this type of tree, every node has only one child that can be either on the left or on the right.

Balanced Binary Tree
It is a binary tree in which, for every node, the height of the left subtree and the height of the right subtree defer by zero or, at most, one.
