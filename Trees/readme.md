The tree is a non-linear data structure in C that contains nodes that are not connected linearly. Rather they are connected hierarchically. The nodes are present at different levels and are connected by edges. Between the set of two connected nodes, the one which is at the upper level is considered a parent, and the lower one is considered a child node.

Ancestors :
Ancestors of a node are the nodes in the path from the root to the current node, including the root node, and excluding the current node are ancestors of the current node.
