A queue in C is basically a linear data structure to store and manipulate the data elements. It follows the order of First In First Out (FIFO).

In queues, the first element entered into the array is the first element to be removed from the array.

For example, letâ€™s consider the scenario of a bus-ticket booking stall. Here, the fashion of a C programming queue is followed. The tickets are distributed on the first-come-first-serve basis i.e. the first one to enter is the first one to be served with the tickets.

A queue is open at both ends. One end is provided for the insertion of data and the other end for the deletion of data.
