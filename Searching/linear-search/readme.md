Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.

Time Complexity:

Best Case: In the best case, the key might be present at the first index. So the best case complexity is O(1)

Worst Case: In the worst case, the key might be present at the last index i.e., opposite to the end from which the search has started in the list. So the worst-case complexity is O(N) where N is the size of the list.

Average Case: O(N)

Auxiliary Space: O(1) as except for the variable to iterate through the list, no other variable is used.
