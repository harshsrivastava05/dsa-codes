In Bubble Sort algorithm, 

<p>traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. </p>
<p>In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first</p>
<p>this process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.</p>

<p>Time Complexity: O(N2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)</p>
